* First we must give our Topic a title, scroll back to the top of the screen and in the _Add Title_ box give your title a name, this is the name that will appear on the homepage.

* In the large box under the title, you can enter a little bit about this topic, this will appear at the topic of the topic page, if you don't want to provide any information on the topic, leave this blank and simply move onto the next step.

As we are creating a new topic we are only interested in the _Child Topic Card Settings_ go ahead and fill in the boxes for your topic.

- Child Topic Card Description - This is the description of the topic that will appear on the card on the home page.
- External Link - If the topic card is to link to an external resource, the link should be provided here.
- Internal Page Link - If the topic card is to link to another page within the platform you can select that here.

Lastly, the topic needs a cover card, to set this, find the _Featured Image_ section in the right hand side of the screen, click the _Set Featured Image_ link and select your media.
