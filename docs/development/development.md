The OurSpace platform is built using the WordPress content management system and a heavily modified theme that sits on top of that cms this means that all of the development of the platform is done in PHP, HTML & CSS

## Developer Requirements
To run linting locally, youâ€™ll need:

- LocalWP installed and available
- PHP installed and available in your terminal
- Composer for managing dependencies
- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code with extensions

## Developing Locally

To develop the theme locally it is advised that the latest version of the platform is cloned [_see how to clone_](/docs/development/how-to-clone.md) from the GitHub repository, you will be able to find this on the `main` branch within that repository. 

Once you have the theme cloned locally, you can use [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) to run a copy of WordPress on your local machine, this will allow you to not only develop the theme locally but also to push the theme changes to the hosting provider [WPEngine](https://wpengine.com/)
