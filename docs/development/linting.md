# Linting & Formatting Setup

This project uses a linting setup to ensure all PHP, JavaScript, and CSS code follows the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/).

Linting helps us:
- Keep the codebase clean and readable 🧼
- Avoid common bugs and formatting issues 🐛
- Make it easier for everyone to contribute consistently 🤝

---

## Tools We're Using

### PHP
- **[PHP_CodeSniffer (phpcs)](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)** — detects violations of coding standards
- **[phpcbf](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)** — auto-fixes fixable violations
- **[WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS)](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards)** — set of sniffs for WordPress PHP code
- **[PHP Stubs for WordPress](https://github.com/php-stubs/wordpress-stubs)** — allows VS Code to autocomplete and understand WordPress functions

### JavaScript & CSS (coming soon)
We may expand linting to JS/CSS via ESLint and Stylelint. Stay tuned!

## Developer Requirements

To run linting locally, you’ll need:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) installed and available in your terminal
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for managing dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional — only needed if/when JS/CSS linting is added)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with extensions (see below)

---

## Setting It Up in VS Code

### Required Extensions

1. **PHP Intelephense**
2. **PHP CodeSniffer** (by Ioannis Kappas)
3. *(optional)* **EditorConfig for VS Code**

### Project Folder Structure

```bash
.
├── vendor/
├── stubs/
│ └── wordpress.php ← copy of wordpress-stubs.php
├── .vscode/
│ └── settings.json
├── .editorconfig
├── composer.json
├── functions.php
└── ...
```
### VS Code `.vscode/settings.json`

```json
{
  "editor.insertSpaces": false,
  "editor.tabSize": 4,
  "phpcs.enable": true,
  "phpcs.executablePath": "vendor/bin/phpcs.bat",
  "phpcs.standard": "WordPress-Extra",
  "intelephense.environment.includePaths": [
    "stubs"
  ],
  "[php]": {
    "editor.insertSpaces": false,
    "editor.tabSize": 4
  }
}
```

### Important
Copy the file `vendor/php-stubs/wordpress-stubs/wordpress-stubs.php` to a local folder called `stubs/` and name it `wordpress.php`
This enables Intelephense to provide autocomplete and stop marking WordPress functions as undefined.

### Running Lint Checks
✅ From the Terminal

Lint the whole project:

```bash
vendor\bin\phpcs -d memory_limit=512M
```

Just to get errors: 

```bash
vendor\bin\phpcs -d memory_limit=2048M --error-severity=1 --warning-severity=0
```

Auto-fix fixable issues:

```bash
vendor\bin\phpcbf -d memory_limit=512M
```

Run just on a specific file:

```bash
vendor\bin\phpcs path/to/your/file.php
```

You can also run composer lint or composer fix if those scripts are defined in composer.json.

### From VS Code
Linting runs automatically on open/save via PHP CodeSniffer

You can run a task to auto-fix:

Press Ctrl + Shift + B

Select Fix PHP with phpcbf (if configured in tasks.json)

### Git Ignore
We do not commit vendor/ or stubs/ folders (they’re dev-time only):

```bash
/vendor/
```

### Other Notes
All PHP files must use tabs for indentation, not spaces

An `.editorconfig` file is included to enforce this across different editors

Final newline and LF line endings are required

PHPCS follows the `WordPress-Extra` ruleset (stricter spacing, formatting rules)

### Help & Troubleshooting
If Intelephense still reports “undefined function” for WordPress functions:

Make sure you've copied wordpress-stubs.php to stubs/wordpress.php

Run Intelephense: Clear Cache from the Command Palette

Restart VS Code
